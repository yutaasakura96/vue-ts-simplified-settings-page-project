## ⚙️ Vue TS Simplified Settings Page Project

This project is built using Vue.js with TypeScript and focuses on creating a simplified settings page using advanced Vue features like Teleport, KeepAlive, and shared state management. The project is styled using Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern design.

This template will help you get started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

# ✨ Features

- 🛠️ Simplified settings page built using Vue.js and TypeScript.
- 🗂️ Tab-based navigation between different settings sections.
- ⚡ Usage of advanced Vue.js features like:
- 🌀 Teleport: For rendering components outside the root DOM.
- 💾 KeepAlive: To cache components and preserve their state when switching tabs.
- 🔄 Shared state management to handle global settings across components.
- 📦 Saving to localStorage: Automatically saves settings locally so they persist across browser sessions.
- 🎬 Custom transitions using Vue.js’ built-in Transition component.
- 🔔 Notification system using useNotifications for real-time notifications with user acknowledgment.
- 🛡️ General, Privacy, and Notifications settings management using useSettings.
- 🛡️ Form validation: Ensures that required fields are filled before submission using centralized validation logic in the useSettings composable.
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first styling.
- 🚀 Built using Vite for fast development and optimized builds.

# 💻 Recommended IDE Setup

For the best development experience, we recommend using Visual Studio Code with the Volar extension:

**[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**
**[Volar Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)** or the **[Official Vue Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin)** (Make sure to disable Vetur if you have it installed).

# 🛠️ Type Support for .vue Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for .vue imports by default, so we replace the tsc CLI with vue-tsc for type checking. In editors, you need Volar to make the TypeScript language service aware of .vue types.

# ⚙️ Customize Configuration

[See the Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/) for more details on how to customize the project’s configuration.

# 📂 Project Structure

- src/: Contains all the source code.
