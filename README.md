##  ⚙️ Vue TS Simplified Settings Page Project

This project is built using Vue.js with TypeScript and focuses on creating a simplified settings page using advanced Vue features like Teleport, KeepAlive, and shared state management. The project is styled using Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern design.

This template will help you get started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

# # ✨ Features

	•	🛠️ Simplified settings page built using Vue.js and TypeScript.
	•	🗂️ Tab-based navigation between different settings sections.
	•	⚡ Usage of advanced Vue.js features like:
	•	🌀 Teleport: For rendering components outside the root DOM.
	•	💾 KeepAlive: To cache components and preserve their state when switching tabs.
	•	🔄 Shared state management to handle global settings across components.
	•	📦 Saving to localStorage: Automatically saves settings locally so they persist across browser sessions.
	•	🎬 Custom transitions using Vue.js’ built-in Transition component.
	•	🔔 Notification system using useNotifications for real-time notifications with user acknowledgment.
	•	🛡️ General, Privacy, and Notifications settings management using useSettings.
	•	🎨 Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first styling.
	•	🚀 Built using Vite for fast development and optimized builds.

# 💻 Recommended IDE Setup

	•	VSCode + Volar (and disable Vetur).

# 🛠️ Type Support for .vue Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for .vue imports by default, so we replace the tsc CLI with vue-tsc for type checking. In editors, you need Volar to make the TypeScript language service aware of .vue types.

# ⚙️ Customize Configuration

See Vite Configuration Reference.
